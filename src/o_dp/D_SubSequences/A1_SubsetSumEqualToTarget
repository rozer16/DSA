In this article, we will be going to understand the pattern of dynamic programming on subsequences of an array.

We will be using the problem "Subset Sum Equal to K".


First, we need to understand what a subsequence/subset is.

A subset/subsequence is a contiguous or non-contiguous part of an array,
where elements appear in the same order as the original array.
For example, for the array: [2,3,1] ,
the subsequences will be [{2},{3},{1},{2,3},{2,1},{3,1},{2,3,1}}
but {3,2} is not a subsequence because its elements are not in the same order as the original array.
