Given an n x n array of integers matrix,
return the minimum sum of any falling path through matrix.

A falling path starts at any element in the first row and chooses the element in the next row
that is either directly below or diagonally left/right.

Specifically, the next element from position (row, col) will be
 (row + 1, col - 1),
 (row + 1, col), or
 (row + 1, col + 1).
