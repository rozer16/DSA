Combination problem theory
 lets say no of rows = n = 2
          no of cols = m = 3


          00    01  02
          10    11  12


 So to reach from 00 to 12 below three paths are possible given we can take only down or right turn

 RRS
 RDR

 Observation 1 : We need to take (n-1)+(m-1)==> (n-m-2) paths to reach from 0,0 to (m-1,n-1)
 Observation 2 : Total no of right turn we can take n-1 and total no of down turns we can take : m-1

 so if we can find how many  no of combination are there for either
    placing n-1 into n-m-2 i.e. (n-m-2) C n-1 OR
    placing m-1 into n-m-2 i.e. (n-m-2) C m-1 ]

we can find total total no of ways to reach 0,0 to n-1, m-1
