We are given a rod of size ‘N’.
It can be cut into pieces.
Each length of a piece has a particular price given by the price array.
Our task is to find the maximum revenue that can be generated by selling the rod after cutting( if required) into pieces.


N = 5

prices = {2,5,7,8,10}

Max Price : 2(1 piece of length = 1)+2*5(2 peice of length = 5) = 12
