* An array is a linear collection of values stored at contiguous memory locations.
* A subarray is nothing but a slice of these contiguous memory locations of the actual array
    or we can say that a subarray is nothing but any contiguous part of a given array.
* A subset is often confused with subarray and subsequence but a subset is nothing but any possible combination of the original array
    (or a set).

* Now, a subsequence is a sequence of the elements of the array obtained by deleting some elements of the array.
The subsequence should not be confused with the subarray or substring. The subarray or substring is contiguous but a subsequence need not be contiguous.

Difference Between Subarray, Subset and Subsequence

Definition of Subarray and Example
    As we know that an array is a linear collection of values stored at contiguous memory locations.
    * So, what is subarray? Well, a subarray is nothing but a slice of these contiguous memory locations of the actual array.
    * In simpler terms, a subarray is nothing but any contiguous part of a given array.
    * The subarray has the same sequence of elements (order of the elements) as it is in the array.
    * subarray is also known as a contiguous subarray. Although a subarray is contiguous (continuous) in nature.

    * Example: Let the array be: arr = [1, 2, 3] Then one subarray of arr can be: subarray = [1, 2] All the sub-arrays of arr are:

    [1]
    [2]
    [3]
    [1, 2]
    [2, 3]
    [1, 2, 3]
    So, we conclude that the size of the subarray can range from 1 to the size of the actual array.



* Definition of Subset and Example
    A subset is often confused with subarray and subsequence but a subset is nothing but any possible combination of the original array (or a set).
    For example, the subsets of array arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] can be:

    [3, 1]
    [2, 5]
    [1, 2], etc.
    So, we can conclude that subset is the superset of subarrays i.e. all the subarrays are subsets but vice versa is not true.


* Definition of Subsequence and Example
    * As the name suggests, a subsequence is a sequence of the elements of the array obtained by deleting some elements of the array.
    * One important thing related to the subsequence is that even after deleting some elements,
      the sequence of the array elements is not changed. Both the string and arrays can have subsequences.

    * The subsequence should not be confused with the subarray or substring.
      The subarray or substring is contiguous but a subsequence need not to be contiguous.

        For example, the subsequences of the array arr : [1, 2, 3, 4] can be:

        [1, 3]
        [2, 3, 4]
        [1, 2, 3, 4], etc.

    * Note: A subarray is a subsequence, a subsequence is a subset but the reverse order is not correct.
