Approach :
In order to count no of proviances we will follow below steps
    1) We will iterate through each edges and call union method
    2) Once we have called union method for all edges, we will have info of who is parent of what
    3) A node and its parent are same that means it is the top node or boss so its one proviance
    4) so we will iterate through each element of parent and count
    5) Return cnt


Intuition
    Using disjoin set we will connect all node and the from parent array we can find how many top nodes are there
